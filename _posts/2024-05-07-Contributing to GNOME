The follwing issue was fixed today: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-clocks/-/issues/359

The solution was quite simple [to do: add code and explain modifications]

We actually spent more time configuring gitlab to be able to use git, there were some issues forking the repository, giving an error that we couldn't clone it, but the reason was just that the gitlab account hadn't been linked yet so we didn't have any space to store the project
