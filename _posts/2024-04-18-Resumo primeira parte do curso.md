### Weekly Progress Log

#### Week 1
I didn't bring my own laptop to class, which prevented me from following the tutorial during the session. However, I successfully completed the tutorial at home the following day without encountering any issues.

#### Week 2
During class, I followed the second tutorial using KW. Initially, everything seemed to run smoothly, and I successfully built a custom Linux kernel. Unfortunately, something went wrong with my virtual machine's console, making it unusable. Thankfully, I was still able to connect to the VM via SSH and execute commands, verifying that the custom kernel was indeed built.

#### Week 3
Again, I began the week's tutorial without issues, but encountered problems during kernel compilation. The VM became completely unresponsive, and I lost the ability to communicate via SSH. Upon inspection, I discovered the VM no longer had an IP address. Despite efforts to debug and pinpoint the issue—and even reattempting the entire tutorial sequence from scratch later in the week—I couldn't resolve the problem.

#### Week 4
Due to persistent issues, I couldn't start the fourth tutorial and instead spent the class working with TAs to debug and identify the root cause. We determined the VM image was corrupted. After copying a fresh image and restarting the tutorials, things initially seemed resolved—even the console issue from Week 2 appeared fixed. However, later that week, when attempting Tutorial 4 at home, the VM once again lost its IP address and displayed the same previous errors.

#### Week 5 (Current Week)
Given the recurring technical difficulties, it was decided I would use a CCSL-provided machine. Most of the class was spent configuring this new setup. Unfortunately, this process meant I couldn't actively contribute to my partner's kernel patch, as they had completed one of the recommended patches before my environment was fully operational. As of submitting this blog entry, I'm still encountering issues and struggling to complete the required tutorials.
